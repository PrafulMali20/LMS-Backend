### **1. `backend/config/`**

- **Purpose**: Contains configuration files related to the project setup, such as database connections or any environment-related configuration.
- **File**:
    - **`db.js`**: This file handles the connection to MongoDB using Mongoose. It’s responsible for connecting the server to the database and logging whether the connection was successful or not.
        - **Role**: It abstracts away the database connection details, making it reusable throughout the project. By separating this logic, the code remains clean and easier to maintain.

---

### **2. `backend/controllers/`**

- **Purpose**: Contains the core logic of your application, such as handling requests, processing data, and sending responses to the client.
- **File**:
    - **`userController.js`**: This file contains functions to handle user-related logic, like registering users, logging in, or updating profiles. These functions get triggered when corresponding routes are hit.
        - **Role**: Acts as a middleman between routes and models. It manages data processing and validation before interacting with the database, ensuring that business logic stays outside of routing or database files.

---

### **3. `backend/models/`**

- **Purpose**: Houses schema definitions for MongoDB collections using Mongoose. These files define how data is structured and managed.
- **File**:
    - **`userModel.js`**: Defines the structure of a "User" in your MongoDB database. This includes fields like name, email, password, and any validation requirements.
        - **Role**: It represents the database schema and is responsible for creating, updating, reading, and deleting documents (CRUD operations).

---

### **4. `backend/routes/`**

- **Purpose**: Contains all the route definitions that specify how your application handles HTTP requests (like GET, POST, etc.).
- **File**:
    - **`userRoutes.js`**: Defines routes related to user actions (e.g., registration, login). This file specifies which controller function gets triggered for each API endpoint.
        - **Role**: Keeps the routing logic separate from controllers and models, ensuring clean code structure. It maps URL paths to corresponding controller functions.

---

### **5. `.env`**

- **Purpose**: Stores environment-specific configurations like database credentials, API keys, and port numbers. These are kept outside of the codebase for security.
- **Role**: Ensures sensitive information like the MongoDB connection string (`MONGO_URI`) is not hardcoded into the application, keeping the app secure and portable.

---

### **6. `app.js`**

- **Purpose**: The entry point for your Node.js backend application. This is where the Express app is created and configured, middleware is applied, and routes are connected.
- **Role**: Initializes the server, connects to the database, sets up middleware like CORS and JSON parsing, and handles the starting point for routing.

---

### **7. `package.json`**

- **Purpose**: A manifest file that holds metadata about the project and manages dependencies, scripts, and versioning.
- **Role**: Lists all installed dependencies (like `express`, `mongoose`), defines scripts (e.g., `npm start`), and holds project metadata.

---

### **8. `README.md`**

- **Purpose**: Documentation file for the project. It describes the project, how to set it up, run, and use it.
- **Role**: Provides essential information about the project to developers or users, such as instructions on how to install dependencies, run the app, and use the available APIs.### **1. `backend/config/`**
